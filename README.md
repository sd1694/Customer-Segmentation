# Customer Segmentation
Dataset
The dataset contains bicycle orders. The first data table bikes.xlsx contains information about various bike models. The second data table bikeshops.xlsx contains information about bike shops. And the third data table orders.xlsx contains the actual order histories with the manufacturer Cannondale. Note, in the orders.xlsx, customer.id refers to the IDs of bikeshops who ordered the bike and the product.id refers to the IDs of specific bike models.

Task
In this assignment, you will first go through some data preprocessing steps and then perform a k-means clustering analysis to analyze customer segmentation of bikes purchasing

Step 1: Data preprocessing

Step 2: Perform k-Means Clustering
- Fit a k-means Clustering model on preprocessed data. 
- Clearly state your choice of the parameter k and your assumption behind choosing a specific k parameter. How many clusters do you think there should be and why?

Step 3: Analyze the result
Now that you have clustered the data, you can inspect the groups find out which customers are grouped together.
- Print out customer names that are in each segment
- Determine the preferences of the customer segments by inspecting factors related to the model (e.g. price point, category of bike, etc.).
